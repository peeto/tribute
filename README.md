# tribute

## This is not the greatest web site in the world, this is a tribute.

I came up with the idea to build this when testing [DarkChat](https://github.com/peeto/DarkChat). It uses [DarkChat](https://github.com/peeto/DarkChat) to somewhat recreate the functionality of the legendary [bianca.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianca.com).

Be wary if you are going to deploy this, [DarkChat](https://github.com/peeto/DarkChat) was created to show PHP developers what with proper encoding anything is possible. This means that there's nothing to stop hundreds of robots from entering a room and using the same name as existing people in the room and constantly spamming the room with attempts at XSS and SQL injections. It also comes with no tools for moderating the site.

Enjoy!
